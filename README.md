# dataviewer
A MATLAB-based viewer for SICM and STED data

The data viewer parses specified directories for files of known data types, generates previews of the files and shows them. It is comparable to the image viewers availabe for most operating systems.

Currently, .sicm and .msr files, generated by our own pySICM software and the Abberior STED instruments are recognized. Data file regonition is, however, implementend in an easy-to-expand manner.

The following thrid-party packages should be installed:
 - SICMToolbox (only the SICM.SICMScan class is required): https://github.com/RUBION-Nanoscopy/phutils
 - BioFormat Matlab Toolbox: https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/downloads/
 - GUI Layout Toolbox: https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox
